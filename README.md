#ASmallApp

This is a fun little project I put together in my spare time, probably will revisit it later. I hope it is useful to someone at some point in time.
This app can act as a ceaser shifter, be used as a calculator, act as a convenient rng, and play a guessing game. All in under 5MB when compiled with optimization. Written on mac. Would probably take minimal changes to work on windows or linux. Might do that at some point.
