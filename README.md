#Learning the Nim programming language by creating a small app.
This is a fun little project I put together in my spare time, probably will revisit it later. I hope it is useful to someone at some point in time.
This app can act as a ceaser shifter, be used as a calculator, act as a convenient rng, play a guessing game, hash your strings, and roughly guess at the length of your inputed text. All in under 5MB when compiled with optimization. Written on mac. Would probably take minimal changes to work on windows or linux. Might do that at some point.
