#ASmallApp

This is a fun little project I put together in my spare time, probably will revisit it later. I hope it is useful to someone at some point in time.
This app can edit files, be used as a calculator, and act as a convenient rng. Written on mac. Would probably take minimal changes to work on windows or linux. Might do that at some point.
I used the NiGui library in this software. My understanding is that I have to include NiGui's license here, or a link to it, so here is the link to it "https://github.com/trustable-code/NiGui/blob/master/license.md". 
This software is licensed under the MIT. Read LICENSE for details.
